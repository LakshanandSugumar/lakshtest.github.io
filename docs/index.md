## Introduction

This datasheet documents my individual work for the EGR 304 course, serving as a living record of my progress, design decisions, and contributions throughout the semester. It is intended to provide a clear, organized, and accessible reference for both instructors and team members, as well as anyone interested in the technical details and process behind our project.

### Project Summary

This project involved setting up Git, GitHub, and a personal datasheet website to document all work for the class. I have completed all required steps, including forking the template repository, configuring my environment, and customizing the datasheet to reflect my individual contributions. My work aligns with the team's overall goals and is designed to integrate seamlessly with the [team report.](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304TeamTemplate/)

The datasheet includes detailed documentation of each assignment component, from initial setup to technical deliverables, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

### My Contribution

- Setting up Git and GitHub for version control
- Creating and customizing this individual datasheet website
- Documenting all required sections, such as the block diagram, component selection, BOM, schematic, and power budget
- Ensuring all links, images, and resources are properly included and accessible

This site is organized to help readers quickly find information. For example:

To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304DataSheetTemplate/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.

For all other sections, please use the navigation menu or the table of contents at the top of the page. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out via my GitHub profile.
